## Codebase Patterns
- Release binaries follow naming convention: `gonzo-{os}-{arch}` (e.g., `gonzo-linux-amd64`)
- Checksums file is named `checksums.txt` and uses sha256sum format
- GitHub Actions workflow builds for: linux/amd64, linux/arm64, darwin/amd64, darwin/arm64, windows/amd64

## 2026-02-01 - Added downloadable install script

### What was implemented
- Created `install.sh` - a POSIX-compliant shell script for one-line installation
- Features include:
  - Automatic OS/architecture detection (darwin, linux, windows + amd64, arm64)
  - Multiple download methods (curl preferred, wget fallback)
  - SHA256 checksum verification using checksums.txt from releases
  - Custom installation directory via `-b` flag
  - Version pinning via `-t` flag (defaults to "latest")
  - Debug mode via `-d` flag
  - Proper cleanup of temporary files
  - PATH hint when installing to non-PATH directory

### Files changed
- `install.sh` (new) - Main installation script
- `README.md` (modified) - Added installation documentation

### Learnings for future iterations
- The release workflow creates binaries named `gonzo-{os}-{arch}` (not compressed)
- Checksums are in `checksums.txt` using standard sha256sum format
- Script uses POSIX sh for maximum compatibility (not bash)
- Chezmoi's install script is a great reference for POSIX-compliant installers

## 2026-02-01 - Enhanced install script with colors and improved UX

### What was implemented
- Enhanced `install.sh` with features inspired by Claude Code and Chezmoi:
  - **Colored output** with automatic terminal detection (respects NO_COLOR env var)
  - **Better default install location**: prefers `~/.local/bin` (like Claude Code)
  - **Force flag (-f)**: allows overwriting existing installations
  - **Quiet flag (-q)**: minimal output for CI/automation
  - **Installation verification**: tests that the installed binary runs
  - **Improved help text**: better formatting with USAGE/OPTIONS/EXAMPLES sections
  - **Uninstall instructions**: added to help output

### Files changed
- `install.sh` (modified) - Enhanced with colors, new flags, improved UX

### Learnings for future iterations
- POSIX sh color codes: use `\033[0;31m` etc. with printf (not echo)
- Detect color support: check `[ -t 2 ]` for terminal and respect NO_COLOR
- Default to `~/.local/bin` as it's the XDG standard for user binaries
- Verify installation by running `binary --version` after install

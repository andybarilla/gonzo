## Codebase Patterns
- Feature input can come from: CLI args, stdin pipe, or file path (if single arg that exists as a file)
- Tests follow the pattern: save originals, defer restore, mock runner, capture stdout with pipe
- Use GOTOOLCHAIN=auto GOSUMDB=sum.golang.org for building (go 1.25 required)
- Commit with --author="Gonzo <gonzo@barilla.you>"

## 2026-02-03 - Feature: Support reading feature details from a file

### What was implemented
- Enhanced `runClaudePrompt` in `pkg/cmd/root.go` to detect when a single argument is a file path
- Added `readFeatureFromFile` helper function that reads file contents when the path exists and is a regular file
- Updated CLI help documentation to describe the three ways to specify a feature (args, file, stdin)
- Added comprehensive tests for the file input feature

### Files changed
- `pkg/cmd/root.go` - Added file input detection logic and `readFeatureFromFile` function
- `pkg/cmd/root_test.go` - Added 7 new test cases covering file input scenarios

### Learnings for future iterations:
- The codebase uses a `newRunner` variable that can be replaced in tests for mocking
- Tests capture stdout using `os.Pipe()` and restore it after the test
- File reading should handle directories gracefully (not try to read them)
- Use `strings.TrimSpace` when reading file content to handle whitespace
